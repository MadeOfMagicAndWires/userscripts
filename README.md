userscripts
==================
Userscripts I made over the years, and used to be up on userscripts.org  
There's a bit of a theme going.

<h2 id="foolslide-download-links">Foolslide Download Links</h2>

Adds Download Links to Foolslide reader links on a (front) page.

Is only set to work for [Akashi Scans](http://akashiscans.com/) 
but should work for any page you know contains links to a FoOlslide reader.



<h2 id="mangastream-torrent-links">MangaStream Torrent Links</h2>

Provides direct image and external download links for the the 
[MangaStream](http://mangastream.com/) Reader.

<h2 id="myanimelist-hover-info">MyAnimeList Hover Info</h2>

Adds hovering info boxes to links on [MyAnimeList](http://myanimelist.net) 
similar to the ones on Top Anime/Manga pages, to normal links.  

**Note**: This is a very dirty hack; it doesn't work great, and it never will.

<h2 id="patreon-creator-activity-only">Patreon Creator Activity Only</h2>

Hides non-creator posts on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/)
from a projects Activity page.
