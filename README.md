userscripts
==================
Userscripts I made over the years, and used to be up on userscripts.org  
Most of them help with downloading manga/comic chapters from online readers,
as I prefer offline readers like [MComix](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcomix/).

<h2 id="botato-download-links">Botato Download links</h2>

Adds direct links to every image of a current chapter on [Botato](http://http://www.batoto.net),
so that they may be easily downloaded.


<h2 id="foolslide-download-links">Foolslide Download Links</h2>

Adds Download Links to Foolslide reader links on a (front) page.

Is only set to work for [Akashi Scans](http://akashiscans.com/) by default,
but should work for any page you know contains links to a [FoOlslide](https://foolcode.github.io/FoOlSlide/) reader.



<h2 id="mangastream-torrent-links">MangaStream Torrent Links</h2>

Provides direct image and external download links for the the 
[MangaStream](http://mangastream.com/) Reader.

<h2 id="myanimelist-hover-info">MyAnimeList Hover Info</h2>

Adds hovering info boxes to links on [MyAnimeList](http://myanimelist.net) 
similar to the ones on Top Anime/Manga pages, to normal links.  

**Note**: This is a very dirty hack; it doesn't work great, and it never will.

<h2 id="patreon-creator-activity-only">Patreon Creator Activity Only</h2>

Hides non-creator posts on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/)
from a projects Activity page.
